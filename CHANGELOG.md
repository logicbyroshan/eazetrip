## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-15

### Baseline Architecture & Production Release

#### Added
- **Full-Stack Multi-Modal Platform**: Comprehensive booking engine supporting Flights, Hotels, Intercity Buses, Indian Railways (IRCTC partner integration), and Holiday Tour Packages.
- **Dedicated Multi-Step Booking Flow**:
  - `/review-booking`: Dynamic itinerary card, multi-passenger forms, optional GST invoicing, travel insurance, zero cancellation shield, and promo code deck.
  - `/booking-payment`: Integrated payment hub supporting UPI QR code scanning, Credit/Debit cards, NetBanking, Mobile Wallets, and Razorpay Smart Checkout.
- **Backend API & Data Store**: Express 4 REST backend with in-memory persistence (`server/data/mockStore.js`), 15+ REST endpoints, recursive null-byte and prototype pollution sanitizers, OWASP security headers, and IP rate limiting.
- **Payment Gateway Engine**: Native Razorpay SDK integration with automatic fallback to Smart Simulation Mode when API keys are unconfigured.
- **Test Suite**: 35 automated tests (`tests/server.test.js`) verifying health, listings, booking lifecycles, auth tokens, input sanitization, prototype pollution protection, and payment webhooks.
- **Design System & UX**: Curated luxury typography (Outfit & Plus Jakarta Sans), smooth Lenis wheel scrolling, glassmorphic filters, and interactive search widgets.

#### Fixed
- Fixed card header alignment on `/review-booking` and `/booking-payment` to ensure icons and titles display side-by-side in horizontal flex rows.
- Configured `overflow-x: clip` in `index.css` and sticky sidebar styles (`position: sticky; top: 90px; height: fit-content; align-self: start;`) on right-column fare summaries.
- Removed redundant full-width top strips and integrated breadcrumb navigation cleanly inside page containers.
- Fixed contact information SMS header icon alignment, enhanced coupon input bar height, and balanced Fare Summary vertical CTA spacing.
